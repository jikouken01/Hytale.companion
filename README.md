## ⚠️ Data & Disclaimer

Most of the data is extracted directly from the game files/assets and then organized and processed for the site. That said, Hytale is still in early access / active development, so a lot of things are incomplete or not fully implemented yet.

Some values are missing, placeholders, or simply don’t exist in the game data at the moment. As development continues, more stats, mechanics, and references should become available, and I’ll keep updating the database as new data appears.

If you notice anything missing or inconsistent, feel free to point it out—feedback really helps! 👍
